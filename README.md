Fibonacci & Merge Sort Project
This project is a small coding exercise to practice working with iteration, recursion, and sorting algorithms in JavaScript. It includes:

What’s Inside

1. Fibonacci Sequence
   Two functions that generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of elements:

fibs(n) – Uses a loop (iteration).

fibsRec(n) – Uses recursion.

For example, calling either function with 8 returns:

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
You can test both versions with different numbers to see how they behave.

2. Merge Sort
   A function called mergeSort(arr) that:

Takes an unsorted array.

Returns a sorted version of it using recursive merge sort.

Example:

mergeSort([3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1]);
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

mergeSort([105, 79, 100, 110]);
Output: [79, 100, 105, 110]
